Todo list:
* Write an introduction
  -- Wrote an embryo, we should polish it though
* Try to expand on the text
* Can we insert more figures from the thesis?
* Add text about our own methods (elude, GradientOptimizer and insilicoamt)
* A discussion speculating on the future of rt-prediction:
  * targeted -> more use of rt
  * DIA
  * deep-learning?
