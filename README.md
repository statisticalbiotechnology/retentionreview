Todo list:
* Go through the introduction - add citations and polish the text 
* Go through the text, do we need to expand it more? If yes, where?
* Go through the last year's literature and add if needed additional works
* Decide upon where we can insert more figures, and which these figures should be 
* A discussion speculating on the future of rt-prediction:
  * targeted -> more use of rt
  * DIA
  * deep-learning?
